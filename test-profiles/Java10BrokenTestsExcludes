// Broker side defect - not creating temp queues with prefixes

// AMQP 1.0 allows more than one txn per session, so our mechanism of installing transaction timeout tickers will need to change

org.apache.qpid.test.unit.transacted.TransactionTimeoutDisabledTest#*

// the received message is being treated as an object message (because it lacks the necessary JMS annotation?)
org.apache.qpid.systest.rest.PublishMessageRestTest#testPublishMapMessage
org.apache.qpid.systest.rest.PublishMessageRestTest#testPublishListMessage

// this test fails - likely a client bug with the modification racing the send
org.apache.qpid.test.unit.basic.BytesMessageTest#testModificationAfterSend

// This test fails with error The underlying correlation-id is not binary and so can't be returned
// however the correlation id in the incoming message was set as byte[] so the issue is within the conversion to
// the InternalMessage and back
org.apache.qpid.systest.management.amqp.AmqpManagementTest#testGetTypesOnVhostManagement

// Test uses AMQP 0-x ack modes and assumes the name of the queues backing subscriptions
org.apache.qpid.test.unit.topic.DurableSubscriptionTest#*

// These tests require some way to set properties on the link established by the client
